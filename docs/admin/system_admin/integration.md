### How To Integrate LeoFS With CDN

There is nothing special to do for integrating LeoFS with CDN[^1]. Since almost CDN service providers take care of a CacheControl Header received from an origin to determine how long a file should be cached on their edge servers, so if you want to modify TTL according to URLs, you can do it by using `http_custom_header.conf`.



### How To Use `http_custom_header.conf`

Append the following line to `leo_gateway.conf` which contains a LeoGateway's directory. Arrange the `http_custom_header.conf` into the path specified at `leo_gateway.conf`.

```ini
## HTTP custom header configuration file path
http.headers_config_file = ./etc/http_custom_header.conf
```

### How To Write `http_custom_header.conf`

The syntax is a subset of **Nginx[^2] configuration**. You can use location contexts to specify TTL and add any headers to the path.

```
location bucket/static {
    expires    12h;
    add_header Cache-Control public;
    add_header X-OriginalHeader OriginalValue;
}
```

In this case, assuming that a CDN service already has been enabled, and there is a file at `bucket/static/path_to_file`, if a user browses that file via the CDN. The CDN will receive a response from a LeoFS system with customized Http headers.

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=43200;
X-OriginalHeader: OriginalValue;
```

### How to Test whether a conf file has any errors

You can do it using the leo_gateway startup script like the following.

```shell
# ./bin/leo_gateway test_http_conf
```

### How to Reload a conf file on the fly

You can do it using the leo_gateway startup script like the following.

```shell
# ./bin/leo_gateway reload_http_conf
```

### Use Cases

Specify TTL by the bucket.

```
location bucket1 {
    expires    1h;
    add_header Cache-Control public;
}
location bucket2 {
    expires    1d;
    add_header Cache-Control public;
}
location bucket3 {
    expires    1h30m;
    add_header Cache-Control private;
}
```

### Appendix
#### Syntax for the expire field

LeoFS supports a part of measurement units which can be used in Nginx configuration. Following time intervals can be specified.

```
s: seconds
m: minutes
h: hours
d: days
```

#### List of verified CDN services

LeoFS Team tested the following CDN services with LeoFS. We recognize that other CDN services also should work.

## Playing video files stored in LeoFS

Since version 1.3.8, LeoFS has supported the HTTP Range header in more precise way than ever so that almost all streaming media clients supporting the progressive download can play video files stored in LeoFS without any hassles. However since LeoFS has not been designed to be placed in DMZ, we'd strongly recommend you put some reverse proxy software in front of LeoFS if you plan to use LeoFS as such use cases in production environment.
