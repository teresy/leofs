## Overview

LeoFS is an **Enterprise Open Source Storage**, and it is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store. If you are seeking a storage system that can store huge amount and various kind of files such as photo, movie, log data and so on, LeoFS is suitable for that.

LeoFS is supporting the following features:

* **Multi Protocol**
  * **S3-API Support**
      * LeoFS is an Amazon S3 compatible storage system.
      * Switch to LeoFS to decrease your cost from more expensive public-cloud solutions.
  * **REST-API Support**
      * To easily access LeoFS with [REST-API](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/admin/protocols/rest/)
  * **NFS Support**
      * NFS support was provided from LeoFS v1.1, the current status of which is beta.
* **Large Object Support**
  * LeoFS covers handling large size objects.
* **Multi Data Center Replication**
  * LeoFS is a highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed file system without SPOF.
  * LeoFS's cluster can be viewed as a huge capacity storage. It consists of a set of loosely connected nodes.
  * We can build a global scale storage system with easy operations

## Architecture

![leofs-architecture-1](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/assets/leofs-architecture.0012.jpg)

LeoFS consists of three core components - [LeoStorage](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_storage/), [LeoGateway](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_gateway/) and [LeoManager](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_manager/) which depend on Erlang.

[LeoGateway](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_gateway/) handles http-request and http-response from any clients when using REST-API OR S3-API. Also, it is already built in the object-cache mechanism (memory and disk cache).

[LeoStorage](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_storage/) handles GET, PUT and DELETE objects as well as metadata. Also, it has replicator, recoverer and queueing mechanism in order to keep running a storage node and realise eventual consistency.

[LeoManager](https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/architecture/leo_manager/) always monitors LeoGateway and LeoStorage nodes. The main monitoring status are Node status and RINGâ€™s checksum in order to realise to keep high availability and keep data consistency.

You can access a LeoFS system using Amazon S3 clients and the SDK</a>.


## Slide

The presentation - <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/rakutentech/scaling-and-high-performance-storage-system-leofs" title="Scaling and High Performance Storage System: LeoFS" target="_blank">Scaling and High Performance Storage System: LeoFS</a>  was given at Erlang User Conference 2014 in Stockholm on June 2014

## GOALs

* LeoFS has been aiming to provide **high reliability**, **high scalability**, and **high cost performance ratio**:
  * HIGH Reliability
     * Nine nines - Operating ratios is 99.9999999%
  * High Scalability
     * Build huge-cluster at low cost
  * HIGH Cost Performance
     * Fast - Over 10Gbps
     * A lower cost than other storage
     * Provide easy management and easy operation

## Build LeoFS with LeoFS Packages

LeoFS packages have been already provided on the Web. You're able to easily install LeoFS on your environments.

* LeoProject
    * <a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/download.html">CentOS 6.x, 7.x</a>
    * <a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/download.html">Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04</a>
* Community
    * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freshports.org/databases/leofs">FreeBSD</a>

<a target="_blank" href="https://leo-project.net/leofs/docs/installation/quick/">Here</a> is the installation manual.


## Build LeoFS From Source (For Developers)

Here, we explain how to build LeoFS from source code.
First, you have to install the following packages to build Erlang and LeoFS.

### Build Dependencies
```bash
## [CentOS]
$ sudo yum install cmake check-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
## [Ubuntu]
$ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ cmake make check libtool
### For Docker
$ apt-get install lsb-release
```

### Install Erlang

You can install Erlang with [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl).

* Install [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl)

```bash
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerl/kerl/master/kerl
$ chmod a+x kerl
$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ mv kerl ~/bin/
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

* Install Erlang (Erlang/OTP 19.3)

```bash
$ kerl build 19.3 19.3
$ kerl list builds
19.3,19.3

$ kerl install 19.3 /path/to/19.3
$  kerl list installations
19.3 /path/to/19.3

$ source /path/to/19.3/activate
$ kerl active
The current active installation is:
/path/to/19.3
```

### Install LeoFS

Then, clone source of LeoFS and libraries from GitHub.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leo-project/leofs.git
$ cd leofs
$ git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop
$ ./rebar get-deps
$ ./git_checkout.sh develop
```

Then, build LeoFS with the following commands.

```bash
$ make && make release_for_test
```

Now, you can find the LeoFS package as follow.

```bash
$ ls package/
leo_gateway/  leo_manager_0/  leo_manager_1/  leo_storage/  README.md
```

Then, we can start and access LeoFS with the following commands. Also, you're able to easily operate LeoFS with [leofs-adm](https://github.com/leo-project/leofs/blob/master/leofs-adm) script.

```bash
$ package/leo_manager_0/bin/leo_manager start
$ package/leo_manager_1/bin/leo_manager start
$ package/leo_storage/bin/leo_storage start
$ package/leo_gateway/bin/leo_gateway start
$ ./leofs-adm status
